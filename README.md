MovieDB
=======

This is just a little app for tracking movies I've seen, want to see, and favorited. It uses themoviedb.org for data.
It uses Rails 4.0.

Install:

1. You need to get an api key from themoviedb.org and set this up in config/application.rb

2. You need to setup your databases in config/database.yml
